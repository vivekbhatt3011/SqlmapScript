# SQLMap Automation Script  

This script automates SQL injection testing using [SQLMap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), a powerful open-source penetration testing tool. It streamlines the process of scanning web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities by providing predefined options and customizable configurations.  

## Features  
- Automates SQL injection testing for URLs, parameters, and POST data  
- Supports database fingerprinting, enumeration, and dumping data  
- Customizable options for verbose output, proxy usage, and tamper scripts  
- Works with cookies, authentication headers, and session tokens  
- Saves scan results for later analysis  

## Usage  
```bash
python sqlmap_auto.py -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --dbs
```

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- SQLMap installed (`git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git`)  

## Disclaimer  
Use this script only on targets you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
